# Mobile Technical Assessment
The goal is to create a simple React Native app from scratch.  The app will allow you to select a California park from a list of available parks, and show an image of that park.

The Zeplin resources reside here: https://app.zeplin.io/project/5d0a727aac271715e7773fc0
The font used is Montserrat and can be obtained from Google Fonts here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat

The app will consist of 3 screens:

## Intro Screen 
This displays before loading the main screen. It displays some instructions and a button to continue on to the Main screen.

## Main Screen
Main screen will have a clickable image and a "Save" button.

Clicking on the image will take you to the List Screen, allowing you to select a park from the list.

Clicking the "Save" button without first selecting a park will show an alert that says "Please select a park first."  For this part of the assessment, clicking "Save" after selecting a park will do nothing.

## List Screen
A list of parks in California. Selecting a park will bring you back to the Main Screen, and the park's image will appear in the image component on the screen.

The data displayed in the list can be hard-coded based on what is in the Zeplin project.

Please push all your code to this repo.

Thanks, and good luck!
