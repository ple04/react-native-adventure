p will consist of 3 screens:

## Intro Screen 
This displays before loading the main screen. It displays some instructions and a button to continue on to the Main screen.

## Main Screen
Main screen will have a clickable image and a "Save" button.

Clicking on the image will take you to the List Screen, allowing you to select a park from the list.

Clicking the "Save" button without first selecting a park will show an alert that says "Please select a park first."  For this part of the assessment, clicking "Save" after selecting a park will do nothing.

## List Screen
A list of parks in California. Selecting a park will bring you back to the Main Screen, and the park's image will appear in the image component on the screen.
